# For this test repository there are three commits:
#   * b5426c8 "master" (v0.1.1-0.20190429073117-b5426c86b553)
#   * a90cfd2 (tag: v0.1.0)
#   * 30950c0

# When requesting master as specific version, a pseudo version is created with a
# higher version than the latest tag. Listing upgrades doesn't suggest the lower
# version as upgrade.
