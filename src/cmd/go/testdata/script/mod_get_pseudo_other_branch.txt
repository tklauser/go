# TODO(jayconrod): get test repo onto vcs-test.golang.org

# Testing that a pseudo-version is based on the semantically-latest
# tag that appears in any commit that is a (transitive) parent of the commit
# supplied to 'go get', regardless of branches

[!net] skip
[!exec:git] skip

# For this test repository:
#  tag v0.2.1 is most recent tag on master itself
#  tag v0.2.2 is on branch2, which was then merged to master
#  commit 5aaa858 is on master at a later point
#
# The pseudo-version hence sorts immediately after v0.2.2 rather
# than v0.2.1, even though the v0.2.2 tag is not on master.
